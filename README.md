# 🧪 Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is diabetic based on medical features such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, age, etc. The model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel and is trained on the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset.
